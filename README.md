# Arche Scriptures (hst version)

To create a dig site at hfK, what would that mean? what type of experience? people would come *as if* something was discovered underneed the soil. I to instigate a thought of memory, understand the present time as the "future past" and what will remain. Which from our voices will be still here, how will they be materialized and entrerpreted? what will become ruin? what will survive? 

## Dig Site

- Where to dig?
    - next to trhe containers?
    - closer to the garders?
    - how big -> 200x200cm?
    - how deep -> 300/500cm?  
- Is the HfK area digable?
- What to do afterwards?
- How to dig?
    - normal shovel?
    - who will help me dig?

## XY Pixel reader 

- Have a 2d Axis servo machine with a pixel scanner attached to it.
- Make the reader go through the clay piece, generating it's sound.
- Have the audio being processed live from the image data.

### Questions

- What would be the optimal encrypting method for this reading process?
    - Perhaps separate fiducial symbols? 
        - not the best usage of space.
        - highest confidest.
        - "high" processing power for needing to run the opencv software. 
    - Pure bits
        - lowest processing possible.
        - no delay between arduino and audio software.
        - less confidence of reading.

## Sound

- Understandable?
- Data processing?
- Translation process?
- Samples?

## Infrastructure

- tent?
- chairs?
    - which, how many
- energy cable
    - from chaos office?
- 

## Text

- How to display the text? (perhaps one of these metal stands that are outside for monuments or something)
- How this text needs to be written?

## Hardware

## Experience

- What experiece this installation will be seeking to create?
    - meditation?
- How to connect to the context of the pandemic from which the project started from?
    - is the "storytelling" necessary or not? It seems that's what interest people the most.
