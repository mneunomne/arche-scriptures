# Arche Scriptures (hst version)

To create a dig site at hfK, what would that mean? what type of experience? people would come *as if* something was discovered underneed the soil. I to instigate a thought of memory, understand the present time as the "future past" and what will remain. Which from our voices will be still here, how will they be materialized and entrerpreted? what will become ruin? what will survive? 

Those pieces were found that, but then the observer time would be considered the future? then the pieces should be about the past, not the future, if im making an assumption that they were found at some other time this needs to be clear somehow, that there is not only a speculation on the point of view of the object, but also the observer. Is this another planet? is this some other place? (now that I realized what petra said about the "now").  

## Dig Site

- Where to dig?
    - next to trhe containers?
    - closer to the garders?
    - how big -> 200x200cm?
    - how deep -> 300/500cm?  
- Is the HfK area digable?
- What to do afterwards?
- How to dig?
    - normal shovel?
    - who will help me dig?

## XY Pixel reader 

![](https://i.imgur.com/IhDbgr3.jpg =500x540)

- go to eletronic workshop see if felix can help me?
- Have a 2d Axis servo machine with a pixel scanner attached to it.
- Make the reader go through the clay piece, generating it's sound.
- Have the audio being processed live from the image data.

### Questions

- What would be the optimal encrypting method for this reading process?
    - Perhaps separate fiducial symbols? 
        - not the best usage of space.
        - highest confidest.
        - "high" processing power for needing to run the opencv software. 
    - Pure bits
        - lowest processing possible.
        - no delay between arduino and audio software.
        - less confidence of reading.

## Sound

- Understandable?
- Data processing?
- Translation process?
- Samples?
- Any references?

## Infrastructure

- tent?
- chairs?
    - which, how many
- energy cable
    - from chaos office?
- water protection

## Equipment list

- __XY Reader scenario:__
    - 2/3 headphones
    - 1 raspberry pi
    - arduino
    - light sensor
    - xy table
    - computer (depends if it will need to run opencv or not, perhaps rasp can handle it)
    - protecting case for rasp
    - power supply rasp
    - working audio cable spliter 

- __Current software scenario:__
    - mac tower (in that case I need to let markus know that I will use it)
    - 2/3 headphones
    - screen (what screen can be outside, and with which mount?)
    - protecting box for computer
    - working audio cable spliter 

## Text

- How to display the text? (perhaps one of these metal stands that are outside for monuments or something)
- How this text needs to be written?

## Experience

- What experiece this installation will be seeking to create?
    - meditation?
- How to connect to the context of the pandemic from which the project started from?
    - is the "storytelling" necessary or not? It seems that's what interest people the most.

## Schedule

What is possible to do in two weeks? I would need to start tomorrow to find the correct XY table, the sensor, arduino, order it.
